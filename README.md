# Rock, Paper, Scissor, Spock, and Lizard Game

The game has two players. In a single round of the game, each player secretly chooses one of three moves, or "throws" â€” rock, paper, scissors, spock or lizard. Then, players reveal their moves at the same time. If both players picked the same move, there is no winner. Otherwise, scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors. Players can play a single round, or "best of eight", or any number of other options.
